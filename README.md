# portfolio-S
Welcome to my portfolio! In this project, I have put my attention to simplicity and being able to update my info as I apply for jobs.

Version 1.0 is done by only using HTML and CSS (with some bootstrap)

I will add other versions if I further develop the website and add more languages. So feel free to contact me if you got any feedback or ideas!
